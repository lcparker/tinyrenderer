# tinyrenderer
This is my implementation of the renderer described at [github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki]. Makefile is included, so if you want to test it run

`make && ./main && display output.tga`

on Linux.

This will render (currently) a man's head, from the files in the obj/ directory.

See the `samples/` folder for examples of output that the program will create. These are `.tga` files and can be viewed with the Linux `display` command.
